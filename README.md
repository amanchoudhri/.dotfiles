# .dotfiles
A collection of the dotfiles I've found to be most helpful, inspired by [this blog post](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/managing-dotfiles).
In addition to storing my preferred settings for vim, ssh, and git, the `setup.sh` script installs `oh-my-zsh` with the following plugins/themes:
- `powerlevel10k`
- `zsh-autosuggestions`
- `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
